This is a Discord bot written in Python, this bot aims to provide an overview of the financial markets discussed on X / Twitter.
Not only data from Twitter is gathered, but other sources are used too, such as Reddit, Binance, Yahoo-Finance, TradingView, and many other related websites.
This bot was written with flexibility in mind, meaning that you can toggle on and off certain features without issues by using the config.yaml file. 

## Installation
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/StephanAkkerman/fintwit-bot
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Twitter Credentials
To access data from Twitter you need to following these steps:
- To be able to get data from Twitter you need to have an account first.
- After signing in go to your [Twitter Home page](https://twitter.com/home), here you can select either **For You** or **Following**. I suggest selecting **Following** as it makes it easier to manage the Tweets the bot will pull.
- Open DevTools (F12) and go to the Network tab.
- Locate **HomeLatestTimeline**, right click on it and press **Copy as cURL (bash)**.
- Create a new file in the root folder of this project named `curl.txt` and paste the contents there.

### Setup .env
If you open `example.env` you will find the lines that need to be filled in. Start by renaming `example.env` to `.env` so the bot will use this file for you credentials.

#### Creating a Discord bot
For the first part, you can watch this [video (watch until 2:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbq7vPsHDtc).

Or follow these written instructions:
- Setup your own Discord bot, following this [written tutorial](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/) or this 
- Give the bot admin rights and all permissions possible, since this is the easiest way to set it up.
- Invite the bot to your server.

At last fill in the lines in the `example.env` file:
- Write your bot token behind `DISCORD_TOKEN:` (line 2)
- Write your server name behind `DISCORD_GUILD:` (line 3)

##### Adding custom emojis (Optional)
The bot uses custom emojis to recognize on which cryptocurrency exchange things can be bought. If you wish to use it, follow these steps:
- Locate the custom emoji pictures [here](https://github.com/StephanAkkerman/fintwit-bot/tree/main/img/emojis).
- Add them to your server ([instructions](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036479811-Custom-Emojis)).
- You can add any exchange emoji, for instance, FTX, as long as the image is supported by Discord and the name is the same as the exchange.

#### Reddit API Credentials (Optional)
If you do not want to track data from Reddit, feel free to skip this step.
I suggest creating a new account for this too, if you feel uncomfortable leaving your username and password.
- Go to https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/ and select **script**.
- The name of the app is needed for `REDDIT_APP_NAME`, click on **make app**.
- This will give you the `REDDIT_PERSONAL_USE` and `REDDIT_SECRET` tokens.
- Finally, fill in your Reddit username and password for `REDDIT_USERNAME` and `REDDIT_PASSWORD`.

## Features
This bot was made with configurability in mind, meaning that every feature listed below can be turned on or off, and be changed easily. If you do not want a feature, just turn it off, all automation and listeners works for your custom roles and channels, so be sure to check out the settings in config_example.yaml and change them to your liking!

### Commands

- `/earnings`: Shows the upcoming earnings data for the specified stock.
- `/(un)follow`: Follows a Twitter user, the bot will then track this user's tweets. Important: This does require setting up Twitter V1 API. If you do not want to do this or cannot get access to the V1 API, then disable this command in the config.

### Listeners
This section is about the other type of automation, which is based on Discord events. 
- On Member Join: When a member joins your server they will get a private message from the bot, where it explains itself.
- On Reaction: If you react with üí∏ under a post, it will get reposted in the dedicated highlights channel. If you react with üêª, ü¶Ü, or üêÇ, it will add the tweet text and the sentiment classification to a .csv file. This file can then be used later for training or testing sentiment models.

### Discord Category and Channel Creation
Since there are multiple channels that are about the same topic, we need to put them in different categories so the bot knows where to find this channel. The categories are specified in the config file, feel free to change the names. Below you can find an example showing how we set up our Discord channel.
